## **_MIT 6.S191 INTRODUCTION TO DEEP LEARNING_**

Hey There, I am **Lucky Langa** - a data dreamer, Ai enthusiast, and a lifelong learner.

This repo is the culmination of  my exploration through **MIT's 6.S191: Introduction to Deep Learning**, a lightning-fast and powerful course that dives into the core of how machine learning learn, see and understand.

## 🚀What's Inside?
Here's the breakdown of the key of concepts and practical implementations I worked on during the course:

### 🧠Neural Network
- An Artifical Neural Network is a machine learning model that is made of Artifical neurons that work together to solve a problem.
- I built and trained **feedforward** and **convolutional** neural network from scratch.
- Explored activation functions(ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh), loss metrics(mse, rmse, mae)
- Explored loss functions(SparseCategoricalCrossEntropy)

## Lab 1 :🎵Sequential Models
-Introduction to fundamentals of Pytorch and  Tensorflow
- Built Music Generation using LTSM

##Lab 2 : 📸Computer Vision
- Built models for **images classification** AND **Debiasing Facial Detection Systems** using **CNN**

## Lab 3 :✍🏽🧠LLM
- I built and fine-tuned a large language model (LLM)
  
## 💡What I learned
This course was more than just lines of code.It was a spark i gained:
- A deeper intuition for how neural network works.
- The Confidence in building models end to end.
